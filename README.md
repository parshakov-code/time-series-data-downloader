# Time Series Data Downloader
Time-Series Data Downloader (TSD) is an open-source Python tool for automating the download and preprocessing of Landsat 1–9 (including MSS and panchromatic), Sentinel-2, GEDI, and other satellite data from GEE, Copernicus, and NASA Earthdata, for user-selected MGRS tiles. TSD preserves the original spectral and spatial resolutions of all products.

## Usage
- Open `TSD.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
- Configure your MGRS tiles, sensors, and download parameters.  
- Run the notebook to automatically download and preprocess satellite imagery.  

TSD is provided as a single Jupyter Notebook and installs all required packages automatically. Detailed explanations of all parameters and workflow steps are included within the notebook, with more detailed description in the article below.

# time-series-data-downloader
Time-Series Data Downloader (TSD) is an open-source Python tool for automating the download and preprocessing of Landsat 1–9 (including MSS and panchromatic), Sentinel-2, GEDI, and other satellite data from GEE, Copernicus, and NASA Earthdata, for user-selected MGRS tiles. TSD preserves the original spectral and spatial resolutions of all products.
